# Assume you have the following code:

# drink3 = {"name" => "water", "ingredients" => ["hydrogen", "oxygen"]}

# Write additional code so that the terminal outputs:

# The drink Seltzer has the ingredients: water, bubbles.
# The drink Coca Cola has the ingredients: water, bubbles, sugar, brown food coloring.
# The drink water has the ingredients: hydrogen, oxygen.

# Note: Write the code in such a way that it would still work even if someone went into the hashes and changed the number of ingredients for any particular drink.
